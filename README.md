Now running on a phone near you!

## ⚠️ Early preview ⚠️

- This package is in an early preview state. Things may break!
- Relies on [Flutter GPU](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/main/docs/impeller/Flutter-GPU.md) for rendering, which is also in an early preview state.
- This package currently only works when [Impeller is enabled](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#availability).
- This package uses the experimental [Dart "Native Assets"](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50565) feature to automate some build tasks.
- Given the reliance on non-production features, switching to the [master channel](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade#other-channels) is recommended when using Flutter Scene.
