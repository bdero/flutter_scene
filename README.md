Now running on a phone near you!

## ⚠️ Here be dragons ⚠️

- This package is in an alpha. Things may break!
- This package uses Flutter GPU for rendering, which is currently in an early preview state.
- This package currently only works when [Impeller is enabled](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#availability).
- This package uses the experimental Dart "native assets" feature to automate some build tasks.
- Given the reliance on non-production features, switching to the master channel is recommended when using Flutter Scene.

Think you can handle it.....? Then welcome aboard!
